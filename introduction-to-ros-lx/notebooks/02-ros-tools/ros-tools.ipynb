    "# Basic ROS Tools\n",
    "There are many tools that ROS offers to the roboticist. In this notebook you will get familiar with the most common and useful ones, allowing you to interact efficiently with ROS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "For this learning experience we have set up a virtual environment with all the tools you are going to need. This means that you don't need to install ROS on your local machine to experiment with its tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you have installed ROS on a new machine, the first step that you need to perform to have access to all of its tools is to *source* the `setup` script. The default script is located in the directory `/opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash`, where `<distro>` is the ROS distribution you have installed. In the environment we set up for you this is `noetic`, but you can always check it by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    env | grep ROS_DISTRO\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print the value of the `ROS_DISTRO` environmental variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To source the script simply run in the terminal of your virtual environment \n",
    "\n",
    "    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\n",
    "\n",
    "**note:** This will make the ROS tools available only in the *current* terminal. In order to make them available in *every* terminal that is opened you have to add this command to the file `~/.bashrc`. You can do so by executing\n",
    "\n",
    "    nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up the `nano` editor. You can move around with the arrow keys and exit it using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>. Remember to input <kbd>y</kbd> to save the file!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write the command `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash` just after the commented lines (the ones starting by `#`)."

    "## Navigating the ROS packages\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS Packages are the software organization unit of ROS code. Each package can contain libraries, executables, scripts, or other artifacts. Each Package is a folder with two essential files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `package.xml`, describing the package (i.e. its name, maintainer, description etc.)\n",
    "* `CMakeLists.txt`, this file contains the list of *dependecies* (i.e. the required packages) for your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create your package you have to create a directory with the appropriate structure, by running in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "    cd ~/catkin_ws/\n",
    "    catkin_make\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two commands create a *workspace* directory and move inside it. The final one populates it with all the files needed to create the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have created the structure of the package you can use the `tree -L 2` command to visualize its structure (the `-L 2` *flag* shows only the two uppermost layers of the directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../assets/_images/package_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make ROS aware that you have this new package available, you need to *source* its setup file as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "    source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "\n",
    "This will *append* the path to this package to the list of ROS packages, which you can always visualize with\n",

    "    echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH\n",
    "\n",
