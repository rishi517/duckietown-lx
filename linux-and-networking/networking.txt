*and then it sends a very large HTML page*

This is a response header!

3) no answer needed

4) This is what sending a bad request to roscore looks like:
<body>
        <h1>Error response</h1>
        <p>Error code: 400</p>
        <p>Message: Bad request syntax ('hi').</p>
        <p>Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST - Bad request syntax or unsupported method.</p>
    </body>

This shows that roscore uses an HTTP (XML-RPC) communication protocol. I was able to figure this out by setting up roscore on my Ubuntu VM and by reading the ros documentation.


Talking to your robot:
1) You can set a unique hostname for your robot. Then, you can use mDNS to find the robot through the hostname; this allows you to connect to the robot
without knowing its ip address

Look Ma, no Internet!:

ATTENTION: This assignment was due before the drone project is due. My drone isn't in a state where I can fully run the tests like finding the IP, so 
my responses are based on intuition over actual results.

1) The raspberry pi is acting as the DHCP Server
2) I cannot run this, but I would run ifconfig after sshing into the pi and also run the same command on my laptop.
3) We could flip it so the laptop is the wireless ap master, and the PI connects to the laptop. The range would be the same, because the devices are the same.

4) 
    a) The Pi can be the wireless ap master and the laptop can connect to it. 
    b) The laptop can be the wireless ap master and the Pi can connect to it.
    c) You can make your phone the wireless ap master and the Pi and basestation can communicate through the phone.
